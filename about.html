            <p class="lead">Walking paraplegic. Master e-bike technician. The kind of mechanic other mechanics bring their bikes to.</p>
            <p>Jerry opened Alcorn Adaptive in 2018 because nobody in the Coachella Valley could fix what he was riding. Now he's built the shop that people drive across Southern California to find. If it's got wheels and a motor, he's probably already taken one apart.</p>

            <span class="timeline-year">2014</span>
            <h3>The Day Everything Changed</h3>
            <p>A tractor fell on Jerry at a construction site. He was paralyzed. Doctors told him what his life would look like now — what he'd never do again, where he'd never go. Jerry listened politely. Then he got to work.</p>
            <p>He retrained his body and his mind from the ground up. Today, he's one of fewer than 2% of paraplegics who can walk. A walking paraplegic — and if you meet him in the shop, you'd never know it unless he told you.</p>

            <div class="timeline-marker"></div>
            <span class="timeline-year">Recovery</span>
            <h3>"I Don't Like the Word No"</h3>
            <p>Recovery was a long road full of people telling Jerry what he couldn't do anymore. He heard every one of them — and took it personally. Not as defeat. As a dare.</p>
            <p>He found cycling through the Desert Ability Center, and it changed everything. Being on a bike again wasn't just exercise — it was proof that the doctors were wrong.</p>

            <div class="timeline-marker"></div>
            <span class="timeline-year">Discovery</span>
            <h3>Stranded in the East Valley</h3>
            <p>On a ride with the DAC, Jerry's bike broke down miles into the East Valley. No repair shops out there. No one in the Coachella Valley who knew how to work on adaptive bikes. He was stuck.</p>
            <p>If you know Jerry even a little, you know what happened next. He went home to his garage and started figuring it out himself. Every great Jerry Alcorn story starts the same way: a problem nobody else is solving, and Jerry deciding he's going to.</p>

            <div class="timeline-marker"></div>
            <span class="timeline-year">2018</span>
            <h3>Alcorn Adaptive Opens Its Doors</h3>
            <p>By 2018, Jerry had already built a reputation the old-fashioned way — word of mouth from people whose bikes actually worked when he was done with them. So when he officially opened Alcorn Adaptive Bike and Mobility Shop, he didn't need a marketing plan. People already knew where to go.</p>
            <p>His name is on the sign because he stands behind every single repair that leaves the shop.</p>

            <div class="timeline-marker"></div>
            <span class="timeline-year">Today</span>
            <h3>Southern California's #1 E-Bike Shop</h3>
            <p>What started in Jerry's garage is now the Coachella Valley's most trusted name in e-bike and mobility repair. Alcorn Adaptive services over 350 brands, is an authorized Lectric eBikes service center, and has expanded into eMoto work for Sur-Ron, Talaria, and more.</p>
            <p>Other shops now come to Jerry to learn. His shop-to-shop training program teaches e-bike diagnostics and repair to technicians across Southern California — because when you've been the best at something long enough, people start asking how you do it.</p>

          <h2>Why People Trust Jerry</h2>
          <p>Jerry knows what it's like to be told you'll never ride again. He knows what it feels like to lose your independence and have to fight to get it back — slowly, painfully, one small victory at a time.</p>
          <p>That's why every bike that comes through his shop gets treated like it matters. Because to the person riding it, it does. Jerry and his team tailor every build, every repair, and every solution to the individual — because he's been the person on the other side of that counter, hoping someone would take the time to get it right.</p>
